<p>I enjoy collecting and reading/skimming textbooks. Sometimes it's to prepare for a course, and other times it's to learn more about an intriguing subject. More recently, I solve the problems at the end of each chapter. I usually don't understand everything, but each time I (re)read a book I gain some new insight, and that's all I really need.</p>

<p>Two resources that I have found quite helpful for my self-study are the <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm">Chicago undergraduate mathematics bibliography</a> and the <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicphys.htm">Chicago Undergraduate Physics Bibliography</a>.
