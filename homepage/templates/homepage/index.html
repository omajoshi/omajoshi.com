<h3>Hi there! Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹</h3>
<p>I am a rising second-year studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Plan II Honors at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>This summer, I'm taking a course in the ECE department on probability and random processes and a course in the math department on number theory.</p>
<p>In the fall, I'm taking ECE courses on quantum mechanics, lasers, and linear systems and signals, part one of Plan II's philosophy sequence, an interdisciplinary course on quantum information science, and classical mechanics.</p>
<p>Here's a more detailed list of <a href="{% url 'homepage:course_list' %}">the courses I've taken and some of my thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>I also enjoy <a href="{% url 'homepage:book_list' %}">collecting and reading textbooks</a>.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Projects</h3>
<p>I am currently modeling and designing a physical Rubik's Cube scrambling and solving robot, using an Ender 3 3D printer, six stepper motors, some motor drivers, and an Arduino Mega. Here are <a href="javascript:void(0)">two</a> <a href="javascript:void(0)">videos</a> of it in action!</p>
<p>I just finished designing this new website! It's a major aesthetic upgrade from my previous homepage, which only had unstyled HTML. If you want, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/omajoshi/omajoshi.com">source code</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, I designed a <a href="https://iqt.txfa.org">tournament tabulation and point tracking program</a> for Texas' state high school speech and debate organization.</p>
<p>Here are the rest of my <a href="{% url 'projects:project_list' %}">projects</a>.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Writing</h3>
<p>During the summer after junior year of high school, I started a blog so I could practice writing. I wrote a few posts about esoteric things like making a super PAC and exploring the Texas Administrative Code.</p>
<p>As part of this website remodel, I built a lightweight blog app using Django and moved all my old posts from Blogger to <a href="#">this site (not up yet)</a>. Maybe I will write more posts sometime.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">These are a Few Miscellaneous Things</h3>
<p>As part of my recent foray into the Star Trek anthology, I started learning the Klingon language (via Duolingo).</p>
<p>On weekend mornings, I enjoy going on long bike rides.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="{% url 'homepage:quote_list' %}">collection of quotes</a> that were memorable to me and that I enjoy rereading from time to time.</p>
