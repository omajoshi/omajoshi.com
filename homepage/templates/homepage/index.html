<h3>Hi there! Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹</h3>
<p>I am a second-year majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Plan II Honors at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>This fall, I'm taking ECE courses on quantum mechanics, lasers, and linear systems and signals, part one of Plan II's philosophy sequence, an interdisciplinary course on quantum information science, and classical mechanics. I'm also a first violinist in the UT University Orchestra!</p>
<p>In the spring, I will be taking some more interesting classes ... to be revealed soon (after registration)!</p>
<p>Here's a detailed list of <a href="{% url 'homepage:course_list' %}">courses I've taken and some of my thoughts on them</a>.</p>
<p>I also enjoy collecting and reading textbooks, and recently I've been trying to read more books (especially nonfiction and science fiction).</p>
<p>Here's a partial list of <a href="{% url 'homepage:book_list' %}">textbooks and books I've read and my thoughts on some of them</a>.

<h3 class="text-center">Projects</h3>
<p>I am currently modeling and designing a physical Rubik's Cube scrambling and solving robot, using an Ender 3 3D printer, six stepper motors, some motor drivers, and an Arduino Mega. Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/q-_97nJyRBk">video</a> of it in action!</p>
<p>I just finished designing this new website! It's a major aesthetic upgrade from my previous homepage, which only had unstyled HTML. If you want, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/omajoshi/omajoshi.com">source code</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, I designed a <a href="https://iqt.txfa.org">tournament tabulation and point tracking program</a> for Texas' state high school speech and debate organization.</p>
<p>I also developed and maintain an <a href="https://extemp.omajoshi.com">extemporaneous debate hosting platform</a> and have used it to host extemp draw at a few debate tournaments in my area.
<p>Here are the rest of my <a href="{% url 'projects:project_list' %}">projects (page in progress)</a>.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Writing</h3>
<p>During the summer after junior year of high school, I started a blog so I could practice writing. I wrote a few posts about esoteric things like making a super PAC and exploring the Texas Administrative Code.</p>
<p>As part of this website remodel, I built a lightweight blog app using Django and moved all my old posts from Blogger to <a href="">this site (not up yet)</a>. Maybe I will write more posts sometime.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">These are a Few Miscellaneous Things</h3>
<p>As part of my recent foray into the Star Trek anthology, I started learning the Klingon language (via Duolingo).</p>
<p>On weekend mornings, I enjoy going on long bike rides.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="{% url 'homepage:quote_list' %}">collection of quotes</a> that were memorable to me and that I enjoy rereading from time to time.</p>

<p>Here are my core web design principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Bootstrap</li>

</ul>
<p>I am currently NOT seeking a position as a front-end web designer.</p>
